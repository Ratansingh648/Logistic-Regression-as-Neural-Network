# Logistic-Regression-as-Neural-Network
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for a single layer neural network for a binary classification of tumors for being Malign or Benign. The dataset contains First column as target variable and rest as attributes for the same. The train and test accuracy for the implementation is 90.5% and 86.90% respectively.
However tuning of hyperparameters are not investigated and could lead to better results also.
